<h1> The Fall of Pixel Gun 3D </h1>
<p> <strong> Became Way Too Win:</strong> </p>
<p> Back in the days of early 2017 and below, Pixel gun 3D was thriving. It was fun, many started as nubs who would grind to get better at the game. But now, as of 2022, Pixel gun 3D has changed, not for the better but for the worst. So many weapons come out of the game, and many are overpowered to an extent where noobs can easily dominate with them. You would actually have to pay in real life currency to dominate, unless your that one percent who is just too good. It's a pain, and believe me it won't be fun to deal with(Talking from experience.) </p>

This just shows and tells you how pricy the game can be to the point the exploiters would put up a guide.</p>
