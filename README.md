<h1> The Fall of Pixel Gun 3D </h1>
<p> <strong> Became Pay Too Win:</strong> </p>
<p> Back in the days of early 2017 and below, Pixel gun 3D was thriving. It was fun, many started as nubs who would grind to get better at the game. But now as of 2022, Pixel gun 3D has changed, not for the better but the worst. So many weapons come out of the game, and many are overpowered to an extent where noobs can easily dominate with them. You would have to pay in real-life currency to dominate, this is unless you that one percent of players who are just too good. It's a pain, and believe me it won't be fun to deal with(Talking from experience.) </p>

<h2> Videos on getting Jems and Coins "Easily" </h2>
 <p> As you scroll through youtube searching for pixel gun 3D content, you would come across multiple videos on how to get coins and gems easily, and how to perform a glitch that would grant you 10000s of gems and coins. This just tells you how pricy the game can be to the point the exploiters would put up a guide. </p>
